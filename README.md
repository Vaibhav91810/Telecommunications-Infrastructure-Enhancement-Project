# Telecommunications Network Simulation and Optimization

## Project Overview
This project aims to simulate and optimize a telecommunications network using MATLAB and Python. The project will involve designing a network topology, simulating data transmission, and optimizing network performance.

## Project Structure
- `simulation/`: Contains the MATLAB and Python scripts for network simulation and optimization.
- `data/`: Contains example network data used for the simulations.
- `reports/`: Contains progress and final reports for the project.

## Requirements
- MATLAB
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vaibhav91810/Telecom_Network_Simulation.git
   cd Telecom_Network_Simulation
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure MATLAB is installed and properly configured on your system.

## Usage
1. Run the basic network simulation using MATLAB:
   ```matlab
   cd simulation
   network_simulation
   ```

2. Run the advanced network simulation with additional features:
   ```matlab
   advanced_simulation
   ```

3. Run the optimization script to improve network performance:
   ```python
   python optimization.py
   ```

## Reports
- Progress reports and the final report can be found in the `reports/` directory.

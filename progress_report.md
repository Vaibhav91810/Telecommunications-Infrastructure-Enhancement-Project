# Progress Report

## Week 1: Research and Planning
- Conducted literature review on telecommunications networks.
- Identified key performance indicators (KPIs) for network performance.
- Prepared a detailed project plan with a timeline and milestones.

## Week 2: Network Simulation Setup
- Designed a simple network topology with nodes and links.
- Implemented the network topology in MATLAB.
- Simulated data transmission and measured performance metrics.

## Week 3: Advanced Network Simulation
- Implemented additional network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, MPLS) in the simulation.
- Simulated various network scenarios (e.g., congestion, packet loss).
- Measured and analyzed the impact of these scenarios on network performance.

## Week 4: Network Optimization
- Identified performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
- Implemented optimization algorithms (e.g., routing algorithms) to enhance performance.
- Measured the performance improvements and compared with the initial results.

## Week 5: Project Management and Reporting
- Developed a detailed project plan with a work breakdown structure, project schedules, and cost estimates.
- Prepared regular progress reports and updates.
- Conducted regular project meetings (virtual) and provided updates to stakeholders.
